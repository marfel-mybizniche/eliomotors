                        <h5>Why Elio?</h5>
                        <h1>The ultimate vehicle for commuting daily</h1>
                        <p>In a nutshell, Elio is the ultimate vehicle for commuting daily. Electric vehicles, like their predecessor gas engines, are increasingly getting more expensive, with an entry level electric starting at just under $40,000. Something needed to give and Elio reversed engineered a solution. With a car entirely engineered from off-the-shelf parts, from the top suppliers in the world, a under 20,000 option was born.</p>

                    <p>And in case you haven’t noticed, the world, and personal space along with it, is shrinking. We simply need to evolve to more efficient and practical forms of transportation.</p>

                    <h5>How It All Began?</h5>
                    <h2>American ingenuity is alive and well. And the world has never been more ready for it.</h2>
                    <p>A few short years ago, automotive enthusiast Paul Elio sized up the prevailing status quo of personal transportation. He saw the soaring costs of the vehicles we drive and electric options going even higher. He saw Americans struggling with an economy that was taking too much and giving back too little. Paul Elio decided that the world was ready for something radically new. The result? A three-wheeled masterpiece of automotive brilliance that bears his name.</p>

                    <blockquote class="small">
                        <p>To provide a fun-to-drive, super-economical personal transportation alternative, that’s affordable, safe, and environmentally friendly. We are committed to the American dream, creating American jobs, and bringing American automotive ingenuity to every vehicle we build. This is, and will remain our mission at Elio.</p>
                        <p>For students the vehicle would offer a safe and reliable means to move around campus. It would allow families with minivans and SUV’s to add an economical commuter vehicle to the driveway. For pure enthusiasts, it would deliver on flat out fun – with a potential for customizing as unlimited as imagination itself. Paul Elio envisioned a vehicle that’s truly for everybody, and its inflation-defying targeted $14,900* base price, sticker price ensures that practically everyone could afford one.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Iyer brings nearly 25 years of product development, business strategy and operations expertise in the automotive industry, and brings to Elio Motors his valuable experience from several executive level and senior operating positions for established and startup automotive companies.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, Mr. Iyer was Executive Vice President at Envia Systems, a Silicon Valley battery company backed by venture investors, where he led all aspects of business strategy and product commercialization. Prior to Envia, Mr. Iyer was Vice President, Engineering at Next Autoworks, a Kleiner Perkins, and Google Ventures funded company. At Next, Mr. Iyer set the original vehicle architecture, led the selection of vehicle technologies and suppliers, was responsible for all module engineering teams (Powertrain, Chassis, Exterior, Interior, Electrical & Vehicle Integration), and was accountable for all vehicle goals, including Safety, Bill of Materials Cost, Fuel Economy, Drivability, Vehicle Dynamics, Craftsmanship, and Product Quality.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Iyer also created and directed the industry’s first collaborative vehicle development process called CarWorks (modeled after Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works that developed the first stealth aircraft for its structure as an elite development team tasked with achieving breakthrough innovation under aggressive time and budget constraints), which involved appointing around 65 major Tier-1 automotive suppliers at the C-level executive and Division President level. The lean and collaborative process resulted in the completion of higher quality, soft-tooled running prototypes in one-third of the budget used by traditional OEM programs. Mr. Iyer successfully led his team to deliver the first production-intent prototypes, performing highly against competitive vehicles and logging over 5,000 miles without technical issues.</p>
                    <p>Before Next Autoworks, he was co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at ESG Engineering, a product development firm specializing in automotive and clean tech applications. Mr. Iyer began his automotive career at Johnson Controls (JCI) Automotive Systems Group, where he was involved in several OEM programs for interiors components.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Iyer received his M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State and his M.B.A. from Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schembri previously was the President of smart USA, a Penske Automotive Group company. He was responsible for the successful launch of smart USA (a division of Mercedes-Benz), which included establishing and maintaining a sales and service retail network, customer relations, logistics, advertising, marketing, PR, government relations, and a parts distribution network.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schembri has over 35 years of automotive experience. The majority of his career was realized in various executive positions at Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen. While at Mercedes Benz, Dave served as both the Vice President of Sales and Vice President of Marketing. During his tenure, Schembri was responsible for several successful product launches while the company recorded 11 consecutive record years in new vehicle sales. In addition to his corporate responsibilities, Mr. Schembri served on the Board of Directors for the Boomer Esiason Foundation (BEF) in their effort to raise funds for research to find a cure for cystic fibrosis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schembri is currently the CEO of the Active Aero Group, a Platinum Equity Company. He attended the University of Detroit, where earned both his Bachelor’s degree and his MBA.</p>
