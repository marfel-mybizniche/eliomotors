					<h2>Terms of Use for the Website</h2>
					<p>In a nutshell, Elio is the ultimate vehicle for commuting daily. Electric vehicles, like their predecessor gas engines, are increasingly getting more expensive, with an entry level electric starting at just under $40,000. Something needed to give and Elio reversed engineered a solution. With a car entirely engineered from off-the-shelf parts, from the top suppliers in the world, a under 20,000 option was born.</p>
